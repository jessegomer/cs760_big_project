Deep learning sentences to get a vector representation of a sentence
With a vector representation of a sentence, using markov models to model paragraphs, chapters, etc
Could also do some sort of clustering of sentences using features i make up

For sentences themselves, could do some sort of markov model to get probability of next word then get posterior
prob of whole sentence
Words can have 4 forms: the word itself, the lexed form, the category of the word (on multiple
levels of specificity), and also the vector representation of the word

What if i modeled who paragraphs using markov models, where sentence breaks are just another symbol
for the markov models, i need to increase history by a bit, cause markov assumption not interesting
or valid

make graph of sentence lenght

make 3 groups on sentences

do hmm with hidden states: start new clause, continue clause, end clause
